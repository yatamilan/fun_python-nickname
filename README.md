# Friendly Greeting App

This is a simple Python-based GUI application built using `tkinter`. The app greets users, simulates an internet speed test, and generates funny nicknames for friends.

## Features

- **Greet a Friend**: Enter a friend's name, and the app will display a personalized greeting.
- **Internet Speed Test Simulation**: Click a button to simulate an internet speed test with a loading progress bar.
- **Funny Nicknames**: After the speed test completes, the app generates a random funny nickname for the friend.

## Installation

1. Ensure you have Python 3.x installed on your system. You can download it from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
2. Install `tkinter` if you donâ€™t have it. It is usually bundled with Python. If you need to install it manually, use the following command:
   - On Ubuntu/Debian: `sudo apt-get install python3-tk`
   - On macOS: `brew install python-tk`

## Usage

1. Clone this repository or download the script file.
2. Run the Python script:
   ```bash
   python friendly_greeting_app.py
Enter a friend's name in the input box and click the "Greet" button to receive a greeting.
Click the "Test Internet Speed" button to simulate an internet speed test with a progress bar.
After the test, the app will generate a funny nickname for your friend.
